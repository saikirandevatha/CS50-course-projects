Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: With a small number of simulations, only one out of three predictions proved right, but as we increased the number of simulations, two out of three predictions proved right.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 10000 simulations
